Accommodation System helps you to create a booking engine for your hotel or any other accommodation you own. Manage rooms and reservations directly from your webiste.

== Description ==

Accommodation System seems to be the right solution when speaking about booking rooms and room types. With a nice and clean design, will bring an awsome reservation system user friendly in both frontend and backend.
In backend you will find a nice dashboard where you will be able to see and manage all the reservations made by customers, along with all the other Accommodation System features. 

In frontend customers will be able too search certain dates for availability, and to make reservations directly through your WordPress website. They can also pay online using multiple payment gateways. 

If you want to use a payment gateway which is not yet available with this plugin, you can use Accommodation System alongside WooCommerce and use their payment gateways.
